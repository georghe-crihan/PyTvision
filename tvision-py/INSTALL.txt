  Read this file to know how to install from sources.

  The package have an unified methode to compile for all the available
platforms. But even with it I give separated instructions for each target.

  Here are the files that describes how to compile for each target:
  [alphabetically sorted]

Borland C++ (5.5, 5.6)                    doc/install/bcc.txt
CygWin                                    doc/install/cygwin.txt
DJGPP (2.02, 2.03)                        doc/install/djgpp.txt
Linux                                     doc/install/linux.txt
Microsoft Visual C (5.0, 6.0, 7.0)        doc/install/msvc.txt
MingWin                                   doc/install/mingwin.txt
UNIX (POSIX) systems                      doc/install/unix.txt

  Important: If you want to contribute to this project you can help me to
keep any of these targets working. You just need to get the CVS changes
periodically compile and tell me if it worked or not.
