Driver: Alcon
Author: Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz, Salvador E. Tropea

Revision: $Revision: 1.1.4.2 $

This is the driver used for various platforms using the Allegro
(a game programming library): http://alleg.sourceforge.net/.
It has the potential of running under the same platforms supported
by Allegro, but at the moment it is being tested only under Linux
(X11 driver precisely).

1. INTRODUCTION

   You will need a version of Allegro installed on your system. The
   driver has the potential to work with a stable Allegro release
   (4.0.x), but on my system I always have the latest unstable
   branch (4.1.x), so you might need this to build the driver. In
   the future I'll make sure it works with 4.0.x, at the moment I
   don't really care as there are not many users (two?).

   Building of the examples/demo seems to work ok. Building of
   Setedit is at the moment not automatic. In order to have
   this driver built by TVision, you need to explicitly pass
   "--with-alcon" to the configure script. And verify that Allegro
   is OK in the output.

   Also, any TVision programs you build with this driver will now
   need the END_OF_MAIN() macro at the end of your main entry point,
   like this:

      #define Uses_TProgram
      #include <tv.h>
      
      int main(int argc, char *argv[])
      {
      ...
      }
      END_OF_MAIN();

   That's needed for Allegro's internal machinery. In order to have
   the END_OF_MAIN declaration you have to request TProgram class,
   but that's usually requested by all sources declaring main.


2. FEATURES

   The driver supports (or rather will some day):

   * Fonts.
   * Palette.
   * Most keyboard combinations, as long as Allegro's driver allows.
   * Mouse.
   * Weird graphic cursor capabilities.


3. CONFIGURATION VARIABLES SPECIFIC FOR THIS DRIVER

   Please read the documentation about the configuration file first.

   This driver has by default a very low priority. It is in
   development, so you will need to bump the priority integer to
   see it working. If you can't see any graphical difference between
   X11 and Alcon, that means Alcon might not have been selected as
   output driver. Ctrl+Alt+End (standard Allegro shutdown keyboard
   shortcut) to see if the program finishes.

   Example of configuration file ~/.tvrc:

       [TV]
       {
           [Alcon]
           {
               Priority=220
               KeyboardMapping="langcode"
               CursorHideNormal=1
               CursorOnSquare=10
               CursorOnCross=15
           }
       }

   The priority has to be an integer number. The higher it is, the
   most likely the AlCon driver will be selected (or rather, tried
   before others).

   The KeyboardMapping is a string specifying the keyboard mapping
   that should be used. By default Allegro looks for an allegro.cfg
   file with the correct keyboard specification. To avoid creating
   one, you can use this variable, which overrides whatever selection
   is used later by Allegro. langcode is a two letter string with
   the iso name of the language. Note that the keyboard mapping
   datafile (keyboard.dat) has to be available somewhere on your
   system for this to have any effect at all.

   CursorHideNormal is an integer variable. If it is different than
   zero, the normal cursor won't be drawn ever.

   CursorOnSquare is an integer variable. If it is different than
   zero, a square will be drawn bordering the cell the cursor is at.

   CursorOnCross is an integer variable. If it is different than
   zero, a cross will be drawn through the cell the cursor is at.

   Note: All the integer variables related to the cursor are
   accumulative.  This means you can set many at the same time and
   get their combined effect.
