  This driver isn't finished yet.
  That's a graphical Win32 driver. Note that graphical just means we emulate
the text drawing it. It doesn't mean the application will use Windows GUI for
buttons, menues, etc.
  If you want to test this driver use a configuration file to chnage the
priority of the driver, use something like 200.
