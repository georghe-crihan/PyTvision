1. INTRODUCTION

  This target is supported because users helped to make it possible. If you
find any problem just do the same the other users did: help to fix them.
  You can also create Win32 versions of this package using BorlandC Builder,
Cygwin, MSVC or MinGW.
  Version 1.3 compiled the code for 2005/09/20 CVS snapshot.


2. HOW TO COMPILE

  You can use the unified make system:

wmake -f Makefile.wat

  This will generate makes/librhtv.dll


3. INSTALLATION

  Currently this target needs manual installation. You can also use the files
without installing just providing the paths to the compiler.
