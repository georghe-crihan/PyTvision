Hi!

  Here you'll find some Turbo Vision examples and widgets. Perhaps I'll
incorporate some of them in the library in the future, but only if I get
feedback.
  The examples were collected from the net and I think they can distributed
freely. Some of them are public domain.
  To compile there are two methodes:

A) You can use the last release of RHIDE available. In this case you just
need to enter in the desired directory and run rhide.
B) Use the make tool. In this case you must enter in the desired directory
and run "make -f file.mak" where file.mak is the name of the .mak file for
this example.

  In both cases is strongly recommended to configure the library using the
configure script.
  The file called rhide.env contains the configuration for your system
generated by the configure script. If you have problems or didn't configure
the library take a look at this file and correct the paths defined there.
  The patchenv.pl Perl script is a small tool to take the definitions found
in rhide.env file and propagate them to all of the .mak files. If you modify
rhide.env and you aren't using rhide you should run it to update the .mak
files.

  All of these examples where easylly ported, read the porting.txt file to
learn what incompatibilities I found while porting the examples.

bhelp    - Implements a Borland's Help file viewer. With it you can read
           BC++ and TC++ help files.
clipboard- This is an example on how to write code using the TVOSClipboard
           class. It gives access to the OS clipboard in an OS independent
           way.
cyrillic - Tests for the cyrillic support. Currently only for KOI8-R. If you
           are interested in more support and can help just contact me. Two
           examples are available: one specifically for Linux console and
           other more generic one but oriented to drivers that can change
           the font (X11, DOS, Linux console, etc.).
demo     - That's the Borland's demo adapted by Sergio Sigala, I did some
           changes to compile it with this port.
desklogo - An example of how to change the desktop appearance. Contributed by
           Joel <jso@europay.com>.
           One of the examples also shows how to stop a TV application using
           ^Z under Linux.
dlgdsn   - That's a dialog design/code generator by Warlei Alves. I included
           it because it could be useful for people not using tools like
           EasyDiag and because Warlei told me he couldn't maintain it and
           asked me to maintain your project.
           Note the code needs a lot of adjustments, I fixed a lot of bugs
           by compiling using -Wall -Werror and I didn't know how to solve
           some details.
dyntxt   - Implements a StaticText with getData/setData member to make it
           "non-static".
fonts    - Here you can see how to set and restore the fonts.
           I also included an example that shows how to handle sft font files
           to generate raw font files.
helpdemo - Shows how to use help context values and how to display context
           sensitive help in the status line.
i18n     - Internationalization for messages. Example using spanish.
inplis   - That's interesting. It implements a class with pairs label/data
           and allows the modification and browse of the data in a scrollabel
           list.
listvi   - That's a buggy example, if you like the idea you could fix it. I
           fixed tons of bugs and still buggy. The idea is similar to the one
           in the inplis example. I included it just because I fixed some
           stuff and perhaps somebody wants to finish it.
msgcls   - It shows the implementation of a message window.
progba   - Implements a progress bar widget. Look how the author polls the
           buttons.
           I also added to it TVCodePage, window title and busy state
           examples.
sdlg     - That's a very good (and usefull) example. It implements a
           scrollable/resizeble dialog box.
sdlg2    - Same as sdlg but more advanced.
tcombo   - Implements a Combo Box widget. The implementation is clean and
           complete. That's a true example ;-).
terminal - That's more a test than an example. I did it to test the class
           because Andris found a bug in the Robert's translation of the
           obfuscated assembler of the Borland's version. It just test the
           TTerminal class.
tprogb   - Another progress bar, less flexible.
tutorial - It contains a very simple example application made in 16 steps to
           show how each thing is added. It was part of some tutorial from
           Borland. I taked it from the Sergio Sigala port. No modifications
           were needed, I just changed #include <tvision/tv.h> by
           #include <th.h> that's the common use. I added some extra
           comments.
tvedit   - Shows how to create a simple text editor.
tvhc     - Turbo Vision Help Compiler. This is a compiler for the original
           help format. This format is binary and I don't recommend using it.
           You can find a better help system in InfView included in the
           SETEdit project.
videomode- Shows how to change the screen/window size using RHTV 1.x modes
           and 2.x resolution style.
xterm    - Shows how to start a XTerm configured to report most key
           combinations. I also included an Eterm 0.9.x theme with the same
           purpose.
