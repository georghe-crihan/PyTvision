Dynamic Text Demonstration
Copyright (C) 1992 by James H. Price, all rights reserved

Introduction

  This program implements a "dynamic text" class.

  The demo consists of the following files:

    DYNTEXT.H                    Header file for DynamicText
    DYNTEXT.CPP                  Member functions for HintStatusLine
    TESTDYN.CPP                  A simple TurboVision demo program
    TESTDYN.PRJ                  Project file for the demo
    README                       This file


Operation:

DynamicText is a simple descendent of TView.  In my current app, I
use it primarily to display totals under a column of input lines,
with the totals updated on the fly as the user inputs data.

A couple of notes on its use:

1.  It has an optional "right justify" flag.  If set to True (the
default), the text will be drawn at the right edge of the view;
otherwise it's drawn at the left edge.

2.  Unlike TStaticText, it has getData() and setData functions, so if
you use it in a TDialog (the expected case) you'll need to add a
field for it in any structure you pass to the dialog via
TDialog::getData() and TDialog::setData.

3.  It has a simple draw function: no centering, no wrapping across
multiple lines, etc, the way TStaticText does.

4.  Note that the length of the text string is set by the value
passed in the TRect parameter.  If the string passed is larger than
the TRect width, the string is truncated.

Other:

I'll be happy to answer questions about the program, but I don't
intend to really 'support' it.  Extending and/or maintaining the code
is left as an exercise for the user!

Any rights which Borland may have to TurboVision-based code remain in
force.  Otherwise, feel free to use this code as you see fit.  I'm
reasonably certain that it works as described, but of course, you use
it at your own risk.  If you distribute this as source code, please
include this file.
