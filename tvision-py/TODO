That's a list of things to do in the project:

* Fix problems when compiling the library with -DNO_STREAM. Laurynas
Biveinis <lauras@softhome.net> contributed some fixes. More work is needed.
* Add some mode where graphic modes aren't restored. Restoring graphic modes
is dangerous in machines with buggy Windows video drivers. Reference report:
0001.txt.
* Implement something like TVIntl, it should handle the intl initialization,
hide the gettext stuff and provide a remapping according to the current App
code page.
