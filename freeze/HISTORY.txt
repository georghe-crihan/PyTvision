Changes from 2.1 to 2.2
 1) Add option (--ext-list-file) to FreezePython to write the list of
    extensions copied to the installation directory to a file. This option is
    useful in cases where multiple builds are performed into the same
    installation directory.
 2) Pass the arguments on the command line through to Win32 GUI applications.
    Thanks to Michael Porter for pointing this out.
 3) Link directly against the python DLL when building the frozen bases on
    Windows, thus eliminating the need for building an import library.
 4) Force sys.path to include the directory in which the script to be frozen
    is found.
 5) Make sure that the installation directory exists before attempting to
    copy the target binary into it.
 6) The Win32GUI base has been modified to display fatal errors in message
    boxes, rather than printing errors to stderr, since on Windows the
    standard file IO handles are all closed.

Changes from 2.0 to 2.1
 1) Remove dependency on Python 2.2. Thanks to Paul Moore for not only
    pointing it out but providing patches.
 2) Set up the list of frozen modules in advance, rather than doing it after
    Python is initialized so that implicit imports done by Python can be
    satisfied. The bug in Python 2.3 that demonstrated this issue has been
    fixed in the first release candidate. Thanks to Thomas Heller for pointing
    out the obvious in this instance!
 3) Added additional base executable (ConsoleSetLibPath) to support setting
    the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable on Unix platforms and restarting the
    executable to put the new setting into effect. This is primarily of use
    in distributing wxPython applications on Unix where the shared library
    has an embedded RPATH value which can cause problems.
 4) Small improvements of documentation based on feedback from several people.
 5) Print information about the files written or copied during the freezing
    process.
 6) Do not copy extensions when freezing if the path is being overridden since
    it is expected that a full Python installation is available to the target
    users of the frozen binary.
 7) Provide meaningful error message when the wxPython library cannot be
    found during the freezing process.

Changes from 1.1 to 2.0
 1) Added support for in process (DLL) COM servers using PythonCOM.
 2) Ensured that the frozen flag is set prior to determining the full path for
    the program in order to avoid warnings about Python not being found on
    some platforms.
 3) Added include file and resource file to the source tree to avoid the
    dependency on the Wine message compiler for Win32 builds.
 4) Dropped the option --copy-extensions; this now happens automatically since
    the resulting binary is useless without them.
 5) Added a sample for building a Win32 service.
 6) Make use of improved modules from Python 2.3 (which function under 2.2)

Changes from 1.0 to 1.1
 1) Fixed import error with C extensions in packages; thanks to Thomas Heller
    for pointing out the solution to this problem.
 2) Added options to FreezePython to allow for the inclusion of modules which
    will not be found by the module finder (--include-modules) and the
    exclusion of modules which will be found by the module finder but should
    not be included (--exclude-modules).
 3) Fixed typo in README.txt.
