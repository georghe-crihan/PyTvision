0.0.1
   Initial release. Contains wrappers for most TVision classes;

   Builds on Linux;


0.0.2
   Added freeze scripts to help building for DOS without LFN support

   PyTVision can now be built for DOS/PythonD with DJGPP (requires
   recompile of PythonD, so it can be statically linked to libpython)

   Tweaked setup.py a little (still needs reworking)

   Removed streams from compatlayer.i

   Typemaps hack fixes a very serious memory leak (20 kb/sec on my machine).
   This is probably due to a bug in SWIG directors code.
       
   cMakeMenu cleanup (debug version of python helped to discover a 
   potential bug)
